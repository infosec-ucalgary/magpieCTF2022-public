You know how we are with our age and all.\n\nWe wanted to suggest some passwords you could use to help us reset our account:\n- password123\n- momandpopsshop\n- qwerty123 (Mom and I think this one could be very strong, since these characters are very similar to the random passwords we currently have)\n- flagshop\n\nRegardless, Mom and I need our passwords reset. I do appreciate you coming in person to tell us the new password in the past, but I think if we use one of the passwords we suggested, you could simply reply with a number that tells us which password to use. Then, that way, you don't need to drive for so long and the password we use is kept hush hush! What do you say Emi?\n\nThanks again for helping us develop this. We are very happy to help you out with your portfolio projects.\nPops\n\nFounder\nMom & Pops Flag Shop","subject":"Password has been forgotten HELP","to":"it@mompopsflags.com"}}}
