  "message":"Hi everyone,\n\nIn our constant exploration to strengthen our system's security, we have discovered a vulnerability within this email system. Due to the severity of this security issue, we have temporarily disabled email sending across the entire server.\n\nWe trust our team. Although we believe no team member would attempt to disrupt our infrastructure, this email server is still public to the internet at large. As such, we have concerns that a third party adversary may attempt to cause damage where they should not.\n\nDisabling email sending completely will prevent this vulnerability from occurring in the future, as the vulnerability involves writing new emails. The IT team is working hard to get this problem solved and restore email functionality as soon as possible.\n\nHope this does not cause an inconvenience. For now, communication can be made in-person, or through personal email. If you do not wish to use your personal email account but still require to send an email to administration, a new email account may be used. Please include your employee id number with every email in all future emails to allow us to confirm your identity.\n\nHave a great day,\nThe IT team\n\nMom & Pops Flag Shop",
