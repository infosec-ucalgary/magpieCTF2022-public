Hello Mom and Pop,

We are pleased to hear that flag sales have been growing at an exponential rate. As previously discussed, this is one of the benefits to joining our company.

We wish to inform you that a new shipment of flags will be coming in very soon.

To get to the point, one of the flags that we have obtained is:
 - magpie{@u+h0r1z@+10n_2_l@x}

You likely understand the value of these flags and understand the gravity of the situation.

Great sacrifices have been made to retrieve these flags, and unfortunately we did not leave unnoticed. With the great notoriety these flags pocess, we must ask you to store these flags for us. We apologize for any inconvenience this may bring, but refusal is would be a breach in our contract.

Please have your IT intern develop a secure storage system for these flags. The provided flag should be more than enough for her to work with.

Thank you for your compliance.

Sincerely,
Your friends at Omni-Flag

Omni-Flag: A Family Company
