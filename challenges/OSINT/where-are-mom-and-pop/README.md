## Description

Mom and Pop were recently spotted on vacation. Rumours have it they took one of their flags with them. They recently uploaded this picture, can you find out where they are? Send their location to the bot and perhaps it can steal their flag when Mom and Pop aren't looking.

Message their location to the bot for the flag and the key to access the next room.

Ex. University of Calgary or Village Ice Cream

## Hints

1. Did you know you can upload pictures to Google Images? Yup, just drag and drop.

## Solution

We open the picture and its a photo of a garden. There doesnt seem to be any signs or anything we can use to narrow down the location. Perhaps we can do a reverse image search.

1. Navigate the Google Images
2. Drag and drop the image into the search bar
3. Hit enter, results pop up with an exact image match
4. The image is of The Butchart Gardens in B.C
5. Go to Discord and open a DM to the bot and send "Butchart Gardens"
6. The bot will respond with the flag and the key to the next room
