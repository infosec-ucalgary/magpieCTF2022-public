final question brainstorm
-------------------------
> Only trust the initials of those away from Omni. They may be rotated by numbers
  that are fortunate, but are not primes of the lunar algorithm.

> Only trust the initials of those away from Omni top to bottom. They shift by
  numbers with fortune, but not by those that are primes of the lunar algorithm.

> Only trust the initials of workers away from Omni top to bottom. They shift by
  numbers with fortune, but not by those that are primes of the lunar algorithm.

> Only trust the combined initials of workers away from Omni top to bottom. They
  shift by numbers with fortune, but not by those that are primes of the lunar
  algorithm.

  shift by fortunate numbers, but not by those that are primes of the lunar algorithm.

todo: 
- split finding ciphertext and deciphering into two explicit steps
- enter a new command `solve`
  - prompt for ciphertext (confirm if the ciphertext is correct)
  - iff the ciphertext is correct, prompt for final passphrase
