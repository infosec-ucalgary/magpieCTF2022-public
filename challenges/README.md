## Challenges

### Overview
Contains source code and solutions for dynamic and static challenges for magpieCTF 2022. 

Challenges are organized into folders based on challenge type.

***
### Folder Organization
Each challenge folder should contain a `README.md` file that has the challenge description (as to be shown on CTFd), challenge solution, and flag.

There should also be a folder called `source/` which contains any source code/scripts that were used to create a challenge. If the challenge is dynamic (i.e. needs to be hosted) then the `source/` folder should contain the `Dockerfile` and any resources needed to build the docker image. Running `docker build` from the `source/` directory should correctly build the challenge's docker container.

There should also be a folder called `solve/` which contains the solve script for the challenge. If your challenge is static and does not need a solve script then this folder may be omitted.

If your challenge is static, then place the static challenge file in the challenge's root directory alongside the `README.md` file. Any file that is not in a folder (i.e. alongside `README.md`) will be made public on CTFd.
