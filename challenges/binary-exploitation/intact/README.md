## Description
Our nmap scan on Mom and Pops has revealed the main program used to authenticate Mom and Pops employees. We have managed obtain a copy of the binary which we will need you to reverse engineer for the purposes of developing an exploit. Can you get us a foothold into their system?

## Hints
1. Null

## Solution

Program that when executed will generate a random password, and then ask for a password. The function that does this uses gets to take in the user provided password. The goal is to overwite the stack and redirect code execution to the builtin win() function. The challenge of this overflow is to maintain the user made stack canary, and make sure both inputpwd[8] and password[8] match, while overwriting the stack. This canary also has a null byte at the end which needs to be included for the Canary check to be successful.

1. Identify the null byte in the user made stack canary
2. Build a stack that will get past the password check, and the canary check
3. Find the minimum amount of bytes needed to overwrite the stack pointer
4. Redirect code to win() function
