# Stacks of Flags
### Category: Binary Exploitation
### Author: Daniel Sabourov (SteamBlizzard)

## Description
You've gained access to an IP on Mom and Pops' Flags that you believe might be vulnerable. It appears to be some sort of search tool to browse the flags they have in stock, but it doesn't seem to work. You also managed to pull the source code running on the site onto your machine. Can you find any vulnerabilities in the binary?

`nc "bin.magpiectf.ca" 1946`

## Hints
1. Is the gets() function exploitable?
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow

## Solution
Cause a buffer overflow and rewrite a line of code such that you open the "flag.txt", causing the program reveal the contents of the file (AKA the flag!) to you.

1. First, try screaming (inputting a lot of letters, like "A" for example) into the program.
    * By doing this we can get a segmentation fault, therefore indicating that the binary is susceptible to a buffer overflow attack!
2. Next, figure out how many characters it takes until you begin to overwrite memory, therefore editing the value of the "file_name" variable.
3. After reaching the required number of characters to begin overwriting, add `./flag.txt` to the end of the string to get the flag!
