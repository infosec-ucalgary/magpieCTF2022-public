2. Did you know that there are multiple variations of this cipher? 

## Solution
The challenge is a variation of pigpen cipher known as [extended pigpen cipher](https://imgur.com/a/ZuURSkR). This variation includes numbers as well. Once the players figure out the cipher, it's simply a matter of decoding the text.
