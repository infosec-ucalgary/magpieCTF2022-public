        We operate all around and inside the globe. Our company is committed to finding synergistic
        and equitable ways to leverage all possible resources of the regions in which we operate in
        order to produce the highest quality of flags.
        <br />
        <br />
        We give back to the communities for the resources they so graciously provide:
        <br />
        <br />
        Our production centers provide jobs to the underprivileged in developing countries, all of whom receive
        excellent benefits like clean water, a washroom break every shift, and even 5% off all flags! (below $5)
        <br />
        <br />
        No longer shall
        people have to be worried about flags spilling into the ocean, causing great environmental damage.
        All competition has been eliminated, ensuring that the production of flags shall solely be under
        the thumb of the great Omni-Flags.
